Feature: simple nmap attack to check for open ports

  Background:
    Given "nmap" is installed
    And the following profile:
      | name     | value        |
      | hostname | myurl.de     |

  Scenario: Check standard web ports
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -F <hostname>
      """
    Then the output should match /80.tcp\s+open/
    Then the output should not match:
      """
      (25|443)\/tcp\s+open
      """
